// ReferencedSecurityScheme alike. Naming the shape once here lets Object stand
// in for what would otherwise be one resolver per aliased type. S is the

// that resolver does not — and a refused chain resolves to nothing, so ObjectAt
// returns before the loop. The bound therefore only ever fires on an absurd
// alias chain.
