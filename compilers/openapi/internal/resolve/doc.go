// Package resolve answers what a $ref names: the same-document pointer it
// addresses, the schema declared there and the type interned there, and, for
// components that are not schemas, the concrete value and declaration site a
// reference-or-inline entry stands for.
//
// It is only that. Following a reference far enough to lower its target
// recurses into the schema walk, so it stays with the walk. What is here needs
// only the document, its path, its declared names and a registry.
//
// Reference resolution is not promoted to compilers/compile: not every compiler
// needs it, and those that do reach it by different mechanisms
// (docs/micro-compiler-design.md §3.2).
